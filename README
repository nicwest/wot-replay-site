requirements
------------
python 2.7
flask
sqlalchemy
flask-openid
flask-sqlalchemy
sqlalchemy-migrate
flask-whooshalchemy
flask-wtf

configs
-------
config-sample.py should be copied and renamed config.py.
this houses all our useful data like db info and application keys, and should probably not be made public.
gitignore should handle this just make sure your config.py has all the same fields as config-sample.py when you update.

WarGaming application Keys
--------------------------
WG require application keys on all severs to access api info:
https://[server].wargaming.net/developers/ [WHERE server = EU|NA|RU|KR|ASIA]

DB stuff
--------
build a mysql table somewhere, enter hosts/username/password/tablename into config.py
run db_create.py once at the start.
run db_upgrade.py (not tested this, but should be fine)
if you make changes to models or add models then run db_migrate.py this should update your database and make a migration script for others (make sure you commit this new migration)
if someone else has made changes and hopefully provided a working migration just run db_upgrade.py and it should adjust your DB to current version.
if something goes horribly wrong then you can do full reset by dropping the all tables and running db_create.py again. (lets try and avoid this)
not sure how this will be handled by merges but we will cross that bridge when we come to it :D
Miguel's advice is not to rename tables/columns but rather to delete/add them, although I have not had any problems so far.

Test stuff
----------
flask runs a built in server for testing, just run run.py and visit the link printed to access the site, debugging is turned on.
all other tests are in the tests folder, this is mainly for testing out wotreplays.py and wotapi.py, but all other tests welcome so long as they are not retarded :D
media and temp folder has gitignore so none of that stuff should make it the repo
